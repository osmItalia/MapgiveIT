          <p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) is a United Kingdom-based non-profit project that is building a free digital map of the world. Online volunteers, or remote mappers, contribute data that creates an accurate, detailed and up-to-date map. There are many free maps on the Internet, but the underlying data in many other maps is not available for the public to use due to legal and technical restrictions. OpenStreetMap opens up the map and the data to the public and makes it free to modify and use under an open license (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank">Open Data Commons Open Database License 1.0)</a>. </p>

          <p>The <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> (HOT) coordinates the creation, production and distribution of free mapping resources to support humanitarian relief efforts in many places around the world through OpenStreetMap. HOT efforts made a significant impact supporting earthquake relief in Haiti in 2010. Launched in January 2009 and incorporated in August 2010 as a U.S. based 501c(3) non-profit organization, its mission is to apply the principles of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.</p>
