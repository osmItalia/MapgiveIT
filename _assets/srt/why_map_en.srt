in

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:11,009
learning to map and OpenStreetMap
introduction

3
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:14,199
not give campaign gives you an
understanding up why

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:17,660
open map data is important to people all
over the world

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,429
and why you should invest your time to
help create map data

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:24,550
online to OpenStreetMap da toward an

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,400
the OpenStreetMap task manager

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,828
the places most in need open map data
creation

9
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,109
maybe places that you've never been to
you that's okay

10
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,448
you can make a big difference simply by
treating roads

11

buildings and other features that you
can spot easily

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,070
from satellite imagery what in this
video tutorial

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,698
will show you how to map in
OpenStreetMap see you can start creating

14
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:51,549
open map data pas this video whenever
you need to you

15
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:56,109
and practice what you just land you can
also find written how-to instructions

16
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,420
under Step 2 on the map give learn to
map page

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,170
before you begin learning how to map
please make sure you have set up and

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,820
OpenStreetMap account

19
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,899
you can find instructions on how to do
that in step 1

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,520
on a map give learn to map page if you
have not signed up for OpenStreetMap

21
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,560
account yet

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,519
please posits video now and do so can
return here

once you set up your OpenStreetMap
account the fine can really begin

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,689
you're about to learn the three main
things you can map in OpenStreetMap

26
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,129
points use to market place's lines

27
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,140
used to mark Rhodes impasse in areas

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,629
used to mark outlines at buildings
fields for any

29
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,739
other large area as you'll soon see
mapping is easy

30
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,309
and you can do it from anywhere in the
world even in places

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,530
that you've never been to you of in our
next steps

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,659
will look at OpenStreetMap and become
more familiar with it

33
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,939
you composites for the OEC any point to
review

34
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:00,149
and practice what you learned along the
way overview OpenStreetMap

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,930
to begin you log in to OpenStreetMap

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,890
once logged in you will see the map to
the right of the map

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,780
I the map controls you consume in zoom
out

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,539
and you your current location on the map
you can also select between layers

39
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:21,699
view the map key share the map I'm a
comment on a particular section

40
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:26,469
pas this video login and take a moment
to locate piece features

41
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,199
OpenStreetMap can return here to learn
to search

42
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,009
in soon in and out in OpenStreetMap
searching OpenStreetMap

43
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,060
is easy on the left side of the screen
is a search

44
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,800
area search for any location in the
world that you like

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,290
simply type the location and a new map
of the area

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,329
you selected will appear for now you
only need to know how to zoom in and

47
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,690
zoom out on the map

48
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,959
uses two min button on the right of the
screen

49
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,340
and examine the map you should be able
to see the three main elements a nap

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,099
points lines in areas pas this video

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,599
and take a moment to practice which is
you man and zoom out buttons

52
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,859
the search field and the three main
elements at the map

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,239
points lines in areas come back

54
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,530
to learn how to create points lines in
areas how to edit

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,550
OpenStreetMap to create points

56
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,590
lines areas in OpenStreetMap click on
the drop down

57
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,250
a row next to the word at the drop down
a route will give you a few options

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,109
select at it with ID in browser editor

59
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,180
there are several ways to edit and
create map data OpenStreetMap

60
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,480
for now the ID in browser editor

61
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,530
is the easiest to use because you will

drop down menu

64
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,590
the ID editor open you'll be able to
create map data

65
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,620
by adding points lines in areas please
pause this video now

66
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,289
open the ID in browser editor from the
drop down menu

67
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,939
and then come back to continue at the
top of the idea editor are the main

you can select which action you'd like
to perform

70
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,649
map a point line or an area

00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,668
the buttons to go back forward and save
are also at the top

72

please pause this video for a moment and
get familiar with the various buttons

work

95
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,810
and you don't have to pick a place you
have been to you or no well

96
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,280
an area with little existing map data is
best

97
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,819
so try practicing in a place that is not
a major city

98
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,279
are heavily developed area of course
you're welcome to practice not being in

an area that you are a no

100
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,839
this may be easier for you to start with
until you're comfortable mapping

101
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,419
how to make a point and OpenStreetMap of

102
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,680
to map a point in the OpenStreetMap ID
editor

map where there's a building

106
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,069
or area that you'd like to define a node
will appear

107

areas that you've never been to be four

111
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,389
you most likely won't know the names at
buildings roads

112
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,300
in areas that's OK too simply marking
point

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,879
is a huge help once you finish adding
details connected to the node

123
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,219
to save often please pass this video and
take a moment to practice mapping

124
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,260
appoint

125
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,769

more points

134
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,810
to establish the line or double-click on
the last point

135
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,990

once you've done that select the edges
and the building our feature you want to

154
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,859
be fine

just click on the corners any editor
will fill in the space

156
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,528

next to the map editor and allow you to
label the area you just defined

or general as you like depending on what

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,710
you can leave this section blank as you
will most likely not know the exact

165
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,430
names at the areas being mapped

166
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:13,329
just label what you can see from the
satellite imagery such as a lake

167
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,650
or building what also always remember to
hit save
