1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,759
in selecting a task

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,929
from the OpenStreetMap tasking manager
introduction

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:14,150
in this video tutorial will show you how
to select

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,160
a task from the map give learn to map
page

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,320
and work with the OpenStreetMap task
manager so you can start mapping

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,460
to make a different now that you know
how to map it's time to put those skills

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,439
to work

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,730
as you seen mapping is easy and soon

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,920
you'll be making and it's taking help
others around the world you may not be

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,100
familiar with them

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,429
or all other locations in need a
humanitarian

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,820
mapping that's okay you can still help

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,939
you simply need to look at satellite
imagery and trace wrote

14
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:49,759
path buildings and areas in the same way
you did

15
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,710
when you return to map you do not need
to know the names are roads and

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,750
buildings to help

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,820
by tracing you are generating map data
that is

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,899
open and available to the world through
OpenStreetMap

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,719
another thing to note even if you only
make

20
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,950
a few map at its duty OpenStreetMap task
manager

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,960
you are helping in a major way there is
no minimum

22
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,099
and every effort helps no matter how
small if we all do a little together

23
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,109
we can accomplish a lot there are
written instructions on the map give

24
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,688
site

25
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:25,399
which may be helpful as you start to map
any OpenStreetMap tasking

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,009
manager if you don't feel comfortable
napping yet please pass this video

27
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,118
and select the how to map tutorial video

28
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,349
from the map gives site come back to
this video

29
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,819
once you are ready getting started

30
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:43,398
from map gives learn to map page scroll
down

31
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,140
be low this video to the section called
select a task

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,140
in this section you will see a list

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,310
a humanitarian mapping tasks select the
one you would like to work on

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,329
once you have selected the task either

35
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:03,629
a new browser tab or window open taking
you directly to the mapping tasks

36
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,429
on the OpenStreetMap tasking manager
website here you will be asked to log

37
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,098
into your

38
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:13,959
OpenStreetMap account this is the same
account you signed up for in step 1

39
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,330
on the Mac your site's learn to map
section you will also be asked to

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,200
authorize

41
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,909

00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,039
starting a task in

45
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,400
once you have signed in and allowed
access here OpenStreetMap account you

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,370
will see the task that you selected from
the map give site

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,269
you will see a map and some information
about the task

48
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,640
the information about the task includes
a description what map give would like

49
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,729
you to focus on

50
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,439
live at task is important instructions

51
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,889
and what to map the individual mapping
tasks

52
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,639
which users have worked on this task and
some stats

53
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,109
about the task

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,500
please pass this video and familiarize
yourself with the OpenStreetMap testing

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,689
manager return to this video when you
are ready

56
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,840
for more details picking a tile to work
on

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
let's use the interactive map and zoom
in

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,330
on highlighted tiles the task has been
broken up into smaller

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,410
tile areas at the map to allow you to do
a little bit mapping

60
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,689
rather than trying to map the entire
area

61
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:31,159
this also lets others simultaneously map
other tiles were areas

62
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,049
by doing this in small pieces you can
all work

63
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,400
faster when you select tile you are
taking a task

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,039
your task is to map that's perfect I'll
by tracing

65
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,879
satellite imagery grey tiles represent
all the task available on this job

66
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,490
reptiles are areas that have been marked
as done

67
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,000
green tiles areas that were marked as
done

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,150
and have also been validated grey tiles

69
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,050
yellow outlines areas that are currently
being worked on

70
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,130
click on a great I'll on the map to
selected

71
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,129
the task tab open in the task tab

72
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,169
click on the green button that says yes

73
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,909
I want to work on this task in by
selecting a tile

74
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,019
you are checking it out no one else will
be able to edit the style

75
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,209
while you are working on it once you
have completed

76
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,329
working on the tile you will need to
check it back in

77
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:33,079
so others can validate my build on your
work well explain how to check areas

78
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,800
back in

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,430
shortening the task tab has a few
additional sections

80
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,930
extra instructions information on how to
credit your edits

81
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,530
and history I'll just ask the extra
ensure chins will contain information

82
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,119
about the imagery

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,410
you're about to work with

84
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,710
highs this video if you need to and make
sure you have correctly selected

85
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,180
a task working on a task in the ID

86
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,030
editor select ID from the editing tool

87
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,508
options this is the same editor you used
to learn how to map

88
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,180
and OpenStreetMap this will open in new
tab or window in your browser

89
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,959
with OpenStreetMap any ID editor and

90
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,418
the ID editor automatically load the
high-resolution satellite imagery

91
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:23,409
for you to Maplin you also see a
bounding box

92
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,820
showing you the exact area marking the
tile you selected

93
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,370
you may need to adjust the satellite
imagery to match with an existing map at

94
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:32,750
it

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,750
this is a very easy process simply click
on the layers button

96
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,870
scroll down to fix alignment and use the
arrow buttons to properly lined up the

97
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,870
high-resolution satellite imagery

98
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,649
with the existing map added you may need
to zoom in fairly close

99
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,120
to do this once you have adjusted the
alignment

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,149
it's time to start mapping adding roads

101
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:00,489
path buildings in areas just like you
did when you learn to map

102
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,000
earlier for example just as you did in
the practice

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,300
identify wrote by looking at 10 and
tracing them

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,470
ecstatic ET when you make a map at it

105
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,919
a dialog box click here you may not know
the specific name if they're older

106
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:16,560
building

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,430
which is okay for instance when you
select

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,430
the building baton on the ID editor your
map

109
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,840
edit is automatically tagged as a
building remember to save after you make

110
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,429
your at it

111
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,918
this insures that your map and its are
available to the entire world

112
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,459
we do ask that you credit your work each
time you save your edits

113
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,969
a collection map at its are called a
change that

114
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,360
and when you save your added you are
essentially applying a commit

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,050
to the OS and database the idea editor
what ask if you want to provide

116
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,590
commit message to your collection at
this information will help us to

117
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,978
understand when at it was made as part

118
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:01,129
have napkins to credit your at it please
click

119

copy the provided credited click back on
the idea editor tab

122
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:16,949
in your browser paste the credit in the
commit

123
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,899
section up the dialog box you can
possibly do. if you need to get familiar

124
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,069
with the editor

125
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,009
and the tracing you're about to do
finishing

126
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,569
a task when you finish mapping an area

127
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,610
or simply decide to stop napping for now
please return to the OpenStreetMap task

128
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,370
manager

129
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,370
and either unlock the task or

130
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,550
market and Stockton unlocking the task

131
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,560
means that you have done some on the map
at it but there are more to do

132
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,899
marking the task is done means that you
have done

133
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,329
all over the map at its possible when
you unlock a task

134
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:59,620
tasking manager was asking for comment
feel free to make whatever comments you

135
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,079
feel

136
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,300
are helpful regarding this task for
example

137
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,338
you could indicate how much of the tiles
complete

138
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:09,528
or a specific features still need work

139
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:12,668
if you have no comment to make simply
write

140
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:17,930
no comment closing if you feel like you
need a little more practice before

141
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,778
jumping in

142
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:22,120
go back to the map give learn to map
page and watch

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,990
the how to map video follow along and
practiced

144
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,370
until you feel confident enough to work
in the task manager

145
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,948
that's it you're now a full-fledged
matter

146
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:36,698
thank you for learning how to map and
also for mapping to make a difference
